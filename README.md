<b>Description</b>
We will walk through a series of dynamo scripts that are short, simple, and designed to help with numerous aspects of Revit. From adjusting line types throughout the drawings, to more complex calculations for parameters, or to do diagnostic coloring. All of these simple, useful tasks can be accomplished with 12 nodes or less. They can be used on conjunction with dynamo player to expand their ease of use.
